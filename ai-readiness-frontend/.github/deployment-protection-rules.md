## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Approval Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PR Created] --> B[Automated Tests]
    B --> C{All Tests Pass?}
    C -->|No| D[Block Merge]
    C -->|Yes| E[Code Review]
    E --> F{Approved?}
    F -->|No| D
    F -->|Yes| G[Merge to Main]
    G --> H[Build & Pre-deployment Tests]
    H --> I{Quality Gates Pass?}
    I -->|No| J[Block Deployment]
    I -->|Yes| K[Request Deploy Approval]
    K --> L[Manual Review]
    L --> M{Deploy Approved?}
    M -->|No| J

    N --> O[Post-deployment Validation]
    O --> P{Validation Pass?}
    P -->|No| Q[Rollback]
    P -->|Yes| R[Deployment Complete]
```

### Rollback Strategy

```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
- Post-deployment validation failures
- Critical performance regression
- Security vulnerability detection
- User-reported critical issues

Rollback Process:
1. Automatic rollback for validation failures
2. Manual rollback approval for performance issues
3. Immediate rollback for security issues
4. Notify team via Slack/Email

Rollback Testing:
- Validate rollback in staging environment
- Test rollback procedures monthly
- Document rollback times and procedures
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring

```yaml
Health Checks:
- Application startup validation
- Database connectivity
- External service availability  
- Authentication service health
- API endpoint responsiveness

Metrics Collection:
- Deployment success rate
- Deployment duration
- Rollback frequency
- Quality gate pass rate
- Security scan results

Alerts:
- Failed deployments (immediate)
- Quality gate failures (immediate)
- Security vulnerabilities (immediate)
- Performance regressions (within 1 hour)
- Coverage drops (daily summary)
```

### Notification Channels

```yaml
Slack Integration:
- Channel: #deployments
- Notifications:
  - Deployment start/completion
  - Quality gate failures
  - Security alerts
  - Performance warnings

Email Notifications:
- Recipients: dev-team@company.com
- Triggers:
  - Production deployment failures
  - Critical security vulnerabilities
  - Sustained quality gate failures

GitHub Issues:
- Auto-create for:
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Recurring deployment failures
  - Performance regression patterns
```

# Staging environment
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/environments/staging \
  --method PUT \
  --field wait_timer=0 \

  --field deployment_branch_policy='{"protected_branches":false,"custom_branch_policies":true}'
```

### 3. Configure Security Alerts

```bash
# Enable vulnerability alerts
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/vulnerability-alerts \
  --method PUT

# Enable automated security updates  
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/automated-security-fixes \
  --method PUT

# Enable dependency graph
gh api repos/:owner/:repo \
  --method PATCH \
  --field has_vulnerability_alerts=true
```
