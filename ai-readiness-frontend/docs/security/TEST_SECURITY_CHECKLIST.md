# Test Security Checklist

## Pre-Test Security Setup
- [ ] Verify test database isolation (separate Supabase project)
- [ ] Confirm test-specific API keys configured
- [ ] Validate test user permissions and access controls
- [ ] Check rate limit bypass configuration for test accounts
- [ ] Verify encryption key separation from production
- [ ] Confirm security monitoring is active for test environment

## Test Environment Security Configuration
- [ ] Test environment file (.env.test) created with proper permissions (600)
- [ ] All secrets generated with cryptographic randomness (32+ characters)
- [ ] Production data access patterns blocked
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately for testing
- [ ] File upload restrictions configured for test safety
- [ ] Security headers configured for test environment

## During Testing Security Checks
- [ ] Monitor for any production data access attempts
- [ ] Validate rate limiting effectiveness during load testing
- [ ] Check authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Verify input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Monitor resource usage to prevent DoS conditions
- [ ] Check security event logging and alerting

## API Security Testing
- [ ] Test API authentication with valid and invalid credentials
- [ ] Verify rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Test input validation on all API parameters
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for XSS vulnerabilities in responses
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection on state-changing operations

## LLM Integration Security Testing
- [ ] Test with separate LLM API keys (not production keys)
- [ ] Verify input sanitization for LLM prompts
- [ ] Check output filtering for sensitive information
- [ ] Test rate limiting on LLM endpoints
- [ ] Verify cost controls and quota management
- [ ] Test error handling for LLM service failures

## Data Protection Testing
- [ ] Verify PII anonymization in test data
- [ ] Test data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Check compliance with data retention policies
- [ ] Verify secure deletion of sensitive test data
- [ ] Test access controls for sensitive information
- [ ] Check audit logging for data access

## Post-Test Security Cleanup
- [ ] Clean up test data automatically
- [ ] Rotate test secrets if compromised
- [ ] Review security event logs for anomalies
- [ ] Check for any security degradation during testing
- [ ] Archive test security reports and metrics
- [ ] Update security baselines based on test results

## Security Incident Response Testing
- [ ] Test incident detection and alerting mechanisms
- [ ] Verify incident response procedures
- [ ] Check communication channels for security alerts
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Verify forensic logging capabilities
- [ ] Test containment and mitigation procedures

## Compliance and Audit Testing
- [ ] Verify audit logging completeness and accuracy
- [ ] Test compliance reporting mechanisms
- [ ] Check data governance controls
- [ ] Verify privacy controls and consent management
- [ ] Test right to deletion and data portability
- [ ] Check breach notification procedures

```

## Critical Security Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è  **NEVER use production credentials in testing**
üîí **Always use separate test database instances**
üîê **Rotate test secrets regularly**
üìä **Monitor security metrics during testing**
üö´ **Block all production data access from test environment**
üìù **Document all security test results**
