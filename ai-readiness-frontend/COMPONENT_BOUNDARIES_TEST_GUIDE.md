# Component Boundaries E2E Test Guide

## Overview

The `component-boundaries.spec.ts` test file provides comprehensive E2E testing for React component boundary issues that commonly occur in Next.js 13+ App Router applications. This test suite specifically addresses the critical issues you mentioned:

1. **Dashboard useState errors**
2. **Login redirect flow problems**  
3. **"Functions cannot be passed directly" errors**
4. **Client component interactivity issues**
5. **Supabase client singleton warnings**

## Test Structure

### üîß Dashboard Client Component Issues
- **useState/useEffect Error Detection**: Monitors console for React hook errors during dashboard loading
- **Interactive Elements Validation**: Tests hover effects, animations, and client-side interactions
- **State Management Testing**: Validates component state consistency across navigation and refreshes

### üîê Login Redirect Flow
- **Hydration Error Prevention**: Detects server/client rendering mismatches during authentication
- **RedirectTo Parameter Preservation**: Ensures login redirects maintain query parameters
- **Authentication State Persistence**: Validates session persistence across page refreshes

### ‚ö° Client Component Interactivity
- **Whimsical Component Testing**: Validates animations, counters, and interactive UI elements
- **Form Interaction Boundaries**: Tests form handlers and event listeners work correctly
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Ensures state updates don't cause boundary violations

### üõ°Ô∏è Supabase Client Singleton Issues
- **Multiple Instance Detection**: Monitors for "multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings
- **Auth State Consistency**: Validates authentication state across components and navigation

### üì¶ Function Passing and Serialization
- **Serialization Error Detection**: Monitors for "Functions cannot be passed directly" errors
- **Props Validation**: Ensures component props are properly serialized between client/server

### üîÑ Error Boundary and Recovery
- **Graceful Error Recovery**: Tests components recover from navigation stress and errors
- **Component Integrity**: Validates components maintain integrity after refreshes and remounting

### üìä Performance and Memory
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Monitors for memory leaks from improper component cleanup
- **Render Efficiency**: Validates components don't cause excessive re-renders

## Running the Tests

### Run All Component Boundary Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e component-boundaries.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Dashboard-specific tests only
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts -g "Dashboard Client Component Issues"

# Login redirect tests only  
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts -g "Login Redirect Flow"

# Supabase client tests only
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts -g "Supabase Client Singleton"
```

### Run with Specific Browser
```bash
# Chrome only
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Firefox only
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts --project=firefox
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with browser visible for debugging
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts --headed --debug
```

## Key Features

### üéØ Console Error Monitoring
The tests actively monitor browser console for specific error patterns:

```typescript
// Examples of monitored errors
- "useState can only be called inside a component"
- "Functions cannot be passed directly to Server Components"
- "multiple GoTrueClient instances"
- "Text content does not match server-rendered HTML"
- "Cannot update a component while rendering another"
```

### üîç Boundary Violation Detection
Tests specifically check for:
- React hook usage in server components
- Function serialization errors between server/client boundaries
- Hydration mismatches
- Memory leaks from improper cleanup

### ‚ö° Real-World Scenario Testing
- Rapid navigation between pages
- Form interactions and submissions
- Authentication state changes
- Component remounting scenarios
- Mobile and desktop viewports

## Error Analysis

### Common Patterns Detected

1. **useState Errors**
   ```
   Error: useState can only be called inside a component
   ```
   - **Cause**: Server components trying to use React hooks
   - **Test**: Dashboard loading without useState errors

2. **Function Passing Errors**  
   ```
   Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Server Components
   ```
   - **Cause**: Passing functions as props between server/client components
   - **Test**: Function passing and serialization validation

3. **Hydration Mismatches**
   ```
   Error: Text content does not match server-rendered HTML
   ```
   - **Cause**: Server/client rendering differences
   - **Test**: Login redirect without hydration errors

4. **Supabase Client Issues**
   ```
   Warning: Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected
   ```
   - **Cause**: Creating multiple Supabase client instances
   - **Test**: Supabase client singleton validation

## Test Results Interpretation

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests Indicate:
- Components properly define client/server boundaries
- No function serialization issues
- Authentication flow works correctly
- Interactive elements function properly
- No memory leaks or performance issues

### ‚ùå Failing Tests May Indicate:
- Server components using React hooks
- Functions being passed incorrectly between boundaries
- Supabase client not properly singleton
- Authentication state inconsistencies
- Memory leaks or cleanup issues

## Integration with CI/CD

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Component Boundary Tests
  run: npm run test:e2e component-boundaries.spec.ts
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS: true
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

### 1. Check Console Output
Failed tests will log specific error messages that caused the failure.

### 2. Enable Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test component-boundaries.spec.ts --headed --debug --timeout=0
```

### 3. Review Screenshots
Failed tests automatically capture screenshots in `test-results/` directory.

### 4. Analyze Traces
Enable tracing for detailed execution analysis:
```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/[test-name]/trace.zip
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run Before Production Deployment**: These tests catch critical boundary issues
2. **Monitor Console Patterns**: Pay attention to the specific error patterns detected  
3. **Test Across Browsers**: Component boundaries can behave differently across browsers
4. **Regular Execution**: Run as part of your CI/CD pipeline
