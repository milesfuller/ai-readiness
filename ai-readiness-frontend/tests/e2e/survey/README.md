- Animation smoothness validation

## Integration with Main Test Suite

### Playwright Configuration
Add to `playwright.config.ts`:
```typescript
{
  name: 'survey-tests',
  testDir: './tests/e2e/survey',
  use: {
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    permissions: ['microphone'],
  },
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Survey E2E Tests
  run: |
    npx playwright test tests/e2e/survey/
    npx playwright show-report
```

## Test Maintenance

### Updating Tests
When survey questions change:
1. Update question count in test helpers
2. Modify category mappings if JTBD structure changes
3. Adjust progress calculations
4. Update mock data to match new requirements

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming convention: `[feature].spec.ts`
2. Include comprehensive console logging
3. Use coordination ID format: `survey-testing-[number]`
4. Store results with Claude Flow hooks
5. Include mobile responsive testing

## Known Limitations

### Browser API Limitations
- **MediaRecorder**: Not supported in all browsers (graceful degradation)
- **getUserMedia**: Requires HTTPS in production
- **AudioContext**: May be blocked by autoplay policies

### Test Environment Limitations
- Voice recording uses mocks (real audio not tested)
- Network conditions simulated (not real latency)
- Animation timing may vary in headless mode

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone permissions**: Tests mock permissions for consistency
2. **Animation timing**: Use `waitForTimeout` for animations
3. **Mobile viewport**: Ensure proper viewport setting
4. **Progress calculations**: Verify question count matches implementation

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Debug specific failing test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/survey/flow.spec.ts --debug

# Record test execution
npx playwright codegen --target javascript

# View test artifacts
npx playwright show-report
```

This test suite provides comprehensive validation of the complete survey functionality with excellent coverage of user scenarios, edge cases, and accessibility requirements.
