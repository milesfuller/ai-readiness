## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Complete Local Supabase Stack
```
Frontend (Next.js) ←→ Kong Gateway ←→ Supabase Services
                                          ├── Auth API (9999)
                                          ├── REST API (3001) 
                                          ├── Realtime (4000)
                                          ├── Storage (5000)
                                          └── Database (54322)
```

### 11 Integrated Services
1. **PostgreSQL Database** - Optimized for testing with relaxed consistency
2. **GoTrue Auth** - No rate limiting, auto-confirmation
3. **PostgREST API** - Enhanced connection pooling
4. **Realtime Service** - WebSocket support
5. **Storage API** - File upload/download with ImgProxy
6. **Kong Gateway** - Production-like API routing
7. **Supabase Studio** - Visual database management
8. **ImgProxy** - Image transformation
9. **Inbucket** - Email testing service
10. **Meta Service** - Database metadata
11. **Test Runner** - Containerized test execution

- **Resource Management**: CPU and memory optimized
- **Fast Reset**: Quick data cleanup between test runs
- **Caching**: Optimized for repeated test execution

## 🛠️ Management Tools

### Infrastructure Script
```bash
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh start    # Start all services
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh stop     # Stop services  
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh health   # Health checks
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh test     # Run test suites
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh clean    # Full cleanup
```

### Service Access Points
- **Database**: `localhost:54322` (PostgreSQL direct access)
- **APIs**: `localhost:8000` (Kong unified gateway)
- **Studio**: `localhost:3010` (Visual database management)
- **Email**: `localhost:9000` (Test email interface)

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### Environment Variables
