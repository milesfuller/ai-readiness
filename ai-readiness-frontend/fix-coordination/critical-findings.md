# CRITICAL FINDINGS - Fix Coordinator Alert

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: New Critical Syntax Errors Detected

**Alert Time**: 2025-08-06
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks all TypeScript compilation

## New File with Syntax Errors:
- `__tests__/types/mocks.ts`: 7 syntax errors
  - Line 49: Missing ']' bracket
  - Line 49: Unexpected declaration statements
  - Line 51: Missing semicolon
  - Line 54: Unexpected declaration

**Impact**: This file may have been created or modified by another agent, causing syntax errors that prevent TypeScript compilation.

## Updated Error Analysis:

### ORIGINAL BASELINE: 192 errors
### CURRENT STATUS: Unknown (compilation blocked by syntax errors)

**Root Cause**: The `__tests__/types/mocks.ts` file appears to have malformed TypeScript syntax that prevents the entire compilation process.

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Priority 1**: Fix syntax errors in `__tests__/types/mocks.ts`
2. **Priority 2**: Re-establish error baseline after syntax fix
3. **Priority 3**: Resume original coordination plan

### ðŸ“‹ Other Agents: ON HOLD
