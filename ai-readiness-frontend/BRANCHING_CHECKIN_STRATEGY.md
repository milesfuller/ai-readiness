### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/phase-{number}-{description}  # Phase branches
feat/{specific-feature}               # Feature branches
fix/{issue-description}               # Bug fixes
hotfix/{critical-issue}              # Production hotfixes
chore/{task-description}             # Maintenance tasks
```

## 🚪 Check-in Gates & Acceptance Criteria

### Phase Gate System
Each phase must pass through 4 gates before merging to develop:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Development] --> B[Gate 1: Code Review]
    B --> C[Gate 2: Testing]
    C --> D[Gate 3: Integration]
    D --> E[Gate 4: Acceptance]
    E --> F[Merge to Develop]
```
