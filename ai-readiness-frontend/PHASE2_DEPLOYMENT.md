# Phase 2: Voice Recording Support - Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests
```bash
# Run voice schema tests
npm test -- tests/voice/voice-schema.test.ts

# Run voice service tests (will fail until services deployed)
npm test -- tests/voice/voice-service.test.ts

# Run voice API tests (will fail until APIs deployed)
npm test -- tests/voice/voice-api.test.ts
```

#### 2. Build Verification
```bash
# Note: Build currently fails due to pre-existing issues with other services
# Voice recording code is not causing the failures
npm run build
```

### Database Migration

#### 1. Review Migration File
```bash
# Check the migration file
cat supabase/migrations/20250108_add_voice_recording.sql
```

#### 2. Apply Migration to Supabase
```sql
-- Connect to your Supabase project and run:
-- Path: supabase/migrations/20250108_add_voice_recording.sql

-- The migration creates:
-- â€¢ voice_recordings table
-- â€¢ transcription_segments table  
-- â€¢ voice_quality_metrics table
-- â€¢ Proper indexes and RLS policies
-- â€¢ Foreign key constraints
```

#### 3. Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('voice_recordings', 'transcription_segments', 'voice_quality_metrics');

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('voice_recordings', 'transcription_segments', 'voice_quality_metrics');
```

### Environment Configuration

#### 1. Required Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local` or production environment:

```bash
# Storage Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key

# Transcription Service (Optional - will use mock if not provided)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key  # For Whisper transcription
# OR
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_key
# OR  
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=path_to_credentials.json
```

#### 2. Supabase Storage Setup
```sql
-- Create storage bucket for voice recordings
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('voice-recordings', 'voice-recordings', false);

-- Set storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'voice-recordings' AND auth.uid() = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own recordings"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'voice-recordings' AND auth.uid() = owner);
```

### Component Integration

#### 1. Add Voice Recording to Survey Pages

```tsx
// In your survey component
import { VoiceRecorder } from '@/components/voice/VoiceRecorder';

// Add to question rendering
<VoiceRecorder
  onRecordingComplete={handleRecordingComplete}
  maxDuration={300} // 5 minutes
  showTranscribe={true}
/>
```

#### 2. Display Recordings List

```tsx
// In your dashboard or results page
import { RecordingsList } from '@/components/voice/RecordingsList';

<RecordingsList
  recordings={userRecordings}
  onTranscribe={handleTranscribe}
  onDelete={handleDelete}
/>
```

### API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available:

- **POST** `/api/voice/upload` - Upload voice recordings
- **GET** `/api/voice/[id]` - Retrieve recording details
- **POST** `/api/voice/transcribe` - Trigger transcription
- **GET** `/api/voice/quality/[id]` - Get quality metrics

### Testing Voice Recording Feature

#### 1. Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Recording Upload:**
   - Navigate to a survey question
   - Click "Start Recording" button
   - Record for 5-10 seconds
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Verify upload completes successfully

2. **Test Transcription:**
   - Click "Transcribe" on a recording
   - Verify transcription starts processing
   - Check transcription appears when complete

3. **Test Quality Analysis:**
   - View quality metrics for a recording
   - Verify SNR, clarity, and other metrics display
   - Check recommendations appear for poor quality

4. **Test File Upload:**
   - Click "Upload Audio" button
   - Select a valid audio file (mp3, wav, etc.)
   - Verify file uploads and processes

#### 2. Performance Testing

```bash
# Test concurrent uploads (requires test files)
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/voice/upload \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -F "file=@test-audio-$i.wav" &
done
```

### Monitoring & Debugging

#### 1. Check Logs
```bash
# Check API logs for errors
npm run dev
# Look for voice-related errors in console

# Check Supabase logs
# Go to Supabase Dashboard > Logs > API
```

#### 2. Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to upload recording" | Check Supabase storage bucket exists and has proper policies |
| "Transcription failed" | Verify API keys are set correctly in environment |
| "Quality analysis timeout" | Increase timeout in voice-service.ts |
| "File too large" | Default limit is 100MB, adjust in API route if needed |

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback using:

```sql
-- Run the rollback section from migration file
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.voice_quality_metrics CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.transcription_segments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.voice_recordings CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_voice_recording_stats;
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### 1. Health Checks
```bash
# Test voice API health
curl http://your-domain/api/voice/health

# Check database tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM voice_recordings;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transcription_segments;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM voice_quality_metrics;
```

#### 2. Monitor Metrics
- Upload success rate
- Average transcription time
- Quality score distribution
- Storage usage
