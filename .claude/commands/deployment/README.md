## Usage

```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Full Vercel + Supabase validation
npx claude-flow deployment validate-all --fix

# Alternative: General deployment testing
npx claude-flow deployment test

# Run E2E user journey tests
npx claude-flow deployment e2e-test

# Specialized (only if needed)
npx claude-flow deployment vercel-validate    # Vercel only
npx claude-flow deployment supabase-validate  # Supabase only
```

## Quick Start for Your Use Case

Based on your previous deployment issues, run:

```bash
# 1. Install Playwright if not already installed
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install

# 2. Run the comprehensive validation
npx claude-flow deployment validate-all --fix

# 3. After all issues are fixed, deploy
vercel --prod
```

This will spawn 10 parallel agents to test everything at once, preventing the back-and-forth debugging you experienced.
